        <Strong>How to Prepare</Strong>
        <p>Pasta brands cook at different times – you'll need to follow the pack instructions rather than using a generic timing.</p>
<ul>
    <Li>Bring a pan of water to the boil and season it with salt.</li>
    <li>Add the spaghetti and stir it gently until all the strands sink beneath the water level. Stir again to make sure they're not stuck together.</li>
    <li>Cook following the pack instructions but taking 2 mins off the time suggested.</li>
    <li>Check the pasta when the time is up by biting into a strand – it should be cooked through but still firm. Cook for a further 1-2 mins if you need to, or if you prefer your spaghetti softer.</li>
    <li>Drain, reserving a little pasta water to add to the sauce. Add the pasta to the sauce straight away so it doesn’t stick together as it cools.</li>
    <li> serve with your favourite sauce and chilled drink</li>
</ul>
